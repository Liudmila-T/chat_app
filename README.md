# chat_app

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

Testing
To test the app locally, you need to install Mockoon and create a mock API environment:

Install and open Mockoon.

Create a new environment with a POST /login endpoint returning a mock response like:

{"success": true, "token": "auth_token"}
Run the mock server on port 3000.

Testing is available on emulators only (iOS or Android). Not tested on real devices.
